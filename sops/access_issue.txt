STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE – ACCESS ISSUE

Purpose:
To resolve cases where the driver cannot reach the customer’s door due to access restrictions such as locked gates, security codes, apartment buzzers, building closures, or restricted locations.

Procedure:

1. Retry Entry Attempt
   - Attempt secondary entrances when safe.
   - Check for callbox, buzzer, or unit number directory.
   - For commercial addresses, request access from reception or service desk.

2. Contact Customer
   - Call customer once (no voicemail required).
   - Send automated SMS requesting access code or gate instructions.
   - If customer responds, driver may attempt immediate re-delivery.

3. Document Access Issue
   - Capture photo of blocked entry if applicable.
   - Add driver note stating exact barrier (e.g., “Gate locked – no code provided”).

4. Re-delivery Scheduling
   - If access remains blocked, schedule a re-delivery within 24 hours.
   - Mark package status: ACCESS_BLOCKED_RETRY.

5. Escalation
   - After 2 failed attempts, escalate to dispatcher.
   - Dispatcher calls customer and confirms access availability for next attempt.
   - If customer unreachable after 48 hours, hold at local station.

6. Final Disposition
   - Customer may pick up at station after 3 consecutive access failures.
   - For repeated gated community failures, flag address for “Pre-call required”.
