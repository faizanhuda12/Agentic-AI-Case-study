STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE – HUB DELAY

Purpose:
To manage delays caused during sorting, scanning, or loading operations at a distribution hub.

Procedure:

1. Identify Delay Type
   - Sorting machine backlog
   - Staffing shortage
   - High package volume
   - Late linehaul arrival

2. Segregate Delayed Packages
   - Label “Hub Delay — Priority”
   - Prioritize for next available vehicle.

3. Customer Notification
   - Deferred delivery update: “Package delayed at sorting facility.”

4. Internal Escalation
   - If delay exceeds 24 hours, station manager reviews capacity allocation.
   - Investigate machine error logs if mechanical fault suspected.

5. Recovery Procedure
   - Add to early-morning “Recovery Route”.
   - Ensure package bypasses nonessential scans.

6. Final Disposition
   - Deliver next business day.
